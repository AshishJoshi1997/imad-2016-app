        <p>see, when we talk about sadness, we are indirectly saying that we are jobless....
        because if we are sad then it means that we had nothing to do thats why we felt sadness...
        </p>
        <p>
            SO ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT BE BUSY...THERE IS NOTHING BAD THAN THE JOBLESSNESS...
            GET BUSY LIVING OR BUSY DYING..
